// To configure blueprint, edit the partials/base.sass file.
// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

!blueprint_grid_columns = 24
!blueprint_container_size = 950px
!blueprint_grid_margin  = 10px

// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set !blueprint_grid_width to a fixed value and unset !blueprint_container_size -- it will be calculated for you.

// Import all the default blueprint modules so that we can access their mixins.
@import blueprint
// Import the non-default scaffolding module.
@import blueprint/scaffolding.sass

// To generate css equivalent to the blueprint css but with your configuration applied, uncomment:
// +blueprint

//Recommended Blueprint configuration with scoping and semantic layout:
+blueprint-scaffolding("body.bp")
body.bp
  +blueprint-typography(true)
  +blueprint-utilities
  +blueprint-debug
  +blueprint-interaction
  // Remove the scaffolding when you're ready to start doing visual design.
  // Or leave it in if you're happy with how blueprint looks out-of-the-box
form.bp
  +blueprint-form
