// To configure blueprint, edit the partials/base.sass file.
// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

!blueprint_container_size = 950px
!blueprint_grid_margin  = 10px

// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set !blueprint_grid_width to a fixed value and unset !blueprint_container_size -- it will be calculated for you.

// Import all the default blueprint modules so that we can access their mixins.

// Import the non-default scaffolding module.
@import blueprint/scaffolding.sass

// To generate css equivalent to the blueprint css but with your configuration applied, uncomment:
// +blueprint

//Recommended Blueprint configuration with scoping and semantic layout:
+blueprint-scaffolding("body.bp")
body.bp
  +blueprint-typography(true)
  +blueprint-utilities
  +blueprint-debug
  +blueprint-interaction
  // Remove the scaffolding when you're ready to start doing visual design.
  // Or leave it in if you're happy with how blueprint looks out-of-the-box
form.bp
  +blueprint-form

// Page layout can be done using mixins applied to your semantic classes and IDs:
body.three-col
  #container
    +container
  #header, #footer
    +column(!blueprint_grid_columns)
  #sidebar
    // One third of the grid columns, rounding down. With 24 cols, this is 8.
    !sidebar_columns = floor(!blueprint_grid_columns / 3)
    +column(!sidebar_columns)
  #content
    // Two thirds of the grid columns, rounding up.
    // With 24 cols, this is 16.
    !content_columns = ceil(2 * !blueprint_grid_columns / 3)
    // true means it's the last column in the row
